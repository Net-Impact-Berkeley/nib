I joined NIB my freshman fall semester so NIB has been my first, oldest, and favorite family on campus. There's really no other organization that invigorates the same warmness, closeness, and love that exists here at NIB. I can't speak enough about how much this club as given me personally, professionally, and beyond, and it's a honor and pleasure to be able to give back and have you potentially join our family here :). I'm passionate about education accessibility, having lived and worked in Nepal with elementary schools there previous to coming into Berkeley, and continuing that passion through working with clients like GoDaddy, Riot Games, and Salesforce here in NIB.

In my free time, I enjoy making Spotify playlists, cooking good food, studying poker strategy, and learning new songs (painfully) on my electric guitar!"
