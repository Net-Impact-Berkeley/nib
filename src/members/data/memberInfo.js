Arriving as an international student, I was honestly overwhelmed by the sheer number of opportunities and groups on campus. It was exciting, but I also felt lost at times, unsure of where I truly belonged. From the moment I joined NIB, that changed. With NIB, I not only tried In-N-Out for the first time (and yes, animal style fries really might beat poutine), but I also found an incredibly intellectually diverse group of people who genuinely care about using business as a force for good, along with the warmest, most supportive family I could have asked for.",
