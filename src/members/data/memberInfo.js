                "Hi there! I'm Mia, a senior from Santa Barbara studying Industrial Engineering and Business and will be a senior advisor this upcoming semester. I joined Net Impact fall of my freshman year and it’s one of the best decisions I’ve made. Throughout my time in NIB I've had the opportunity to work on amazing projects on girl's education, vaccine procurement in Africa, and regenerative agriculture. My projects have allowed me to learn, grow, and most importantly meet some of my closest friends! NIB has truly become my family.",
                "Outside of school and NIB, you can find me running half marathons, playing sports (tennis, pickleball, volleyball), practicing photography, hiking, listening to indie music, and chasing sunsets. I’m excited to meet you all!"
