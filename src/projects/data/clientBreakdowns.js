                aboutClient: "Best Buy’s primary social impact initiative is their Teen Tech Center program which provides after-school environments for teens in underserved communities and provides access to technology and mentorship. At the time of this project, there were 41 Teen Tech Centers across the United States serving over 30,000 teens. Best Buy plans to build this network to 100 centers by 2025.",
                ourWork: "Phase 1: Research Foundation Conducted literature reviews and case studies on teen leadership development and existing youth programs. Undertook internal interviews with Best Buy Foundation staff to understand the landscape. Established a robust foundation for the Teen Leadership Council program. Phase 2: Strategy Development. Crafted a comprehensive council program for the Teen Tech Center initiative. Considered key factors such as structure, adult-youth dynamics, incentives, and benefits. Created four user personas to guide strategy and explore various scenarios",
                impact: "We presented our deliverables to over 30 Best Buy Foundation executives and employees. With both research and strategy, we were able to create a holistic project that balanced the needs of the company with the benefits for youth. \n Our client was truly enthusiastic about the information and ideas that we presented. As the Teen Tech Center program grows, I am confident that our ideas for the council will be implemented and provide further opportunities for youth across the country. \n This project enabled my team to expand their knowledge and skills in multiple areas. My associates developed research skills, led interviews with employees across the company, created strategies that incorporated many factors and limitations, and utilized design thinking for user personas. It was an amazing opportunity to have an impact on tech accessibility for youth and create solutions for the real world. \n On a more personal note, leading this project was the most rewarding experience that I had in college. I became more confident in myself as a leader, worked in a social impact area that I’ve been passionate about since high school, and created bonds with my team that will last a lifetime. I still cannot believe that I had the opportunity to lead a project for a Fortune 500 company while still in college. I learned things about collaboration, client relationships, leadership style, and project execution that I will carry with me as I build my career. I couldn’t have done it without my team - Matt, Jess, Ryan, and Eddie. Thank you for making my project vision come true!",

                ourWork: "The goal of this project is to provide comprehensive market research and propose implementation strategies to be integrated into Salesforce.org’s social impact measurement practices.

We ensure Kaiser Permanente’s spending decisions are environmentally sound, economically viable, and socially equitable. We target spend in our communities to address economic and environmental disparities, ultimately creating positive health outcomes. For this project, we conducted impact evaluation for two of their existing programs, one regarding mental health for startup/business leadership, and the used employee ownership to increase and promote community wealth and wellbeing.

                impact: "Worked with Kaiser Permanente’s (KP) Impact Spending Team to analyze and improve the two social impact programs valued at 600k, one focused on mental health training for business leaders and the other on converting suppliers to employee-owned. Created a logic model to quantitatively capture the relationship between inputs, outputs, and impacts for both programs by conducting 15+ informational interviews and analyzing KP data. Developed strategies to maximize the impact and efficiency of both programs by conducting market research, building case studies, and holding informational interviews with program participants. Identified 10+ pain points in KP’s current approach for program design and outlined a new process to launch and secure funding for future programs. Identified ten impact investment areas by analyzing industry ESG trends; used case studies to formulate specific solutions that align with KP’s goals of supporting job creation, diverse suppliers, and sustainability. Helped inform 500+ companies on employee ownership, create 200+ worker-owners, and transition 6+ suppliers by identifying strengths and weaknesses in the Employee Ownership program and offering solutions."

                ourWork: "The client wanted us to find ways to reimagine LUNAFEST that would make the program more sustainable for the company as a social impact marketing strategy while maintaining or growing its impact on the communities it's connected to. We approached the problem by first looking at how LUNAFEST was faring in the current market, researching trends within the target demographic for LUNA, and assessing peer companies to get context in the space. We then strategized different directions for LUNAFEST to grow into, considering both feasibility and impact. Finally, we broke down the actionable steps for LUNAFEST to begin implementing these strategies and what benchmarks they can use to evaluate their success.",
                impact: "We delivered 3 reimagined LUNAFEST roadmaps that we presented in-person to the heads of the program and Clif Bar's brand director. We also created a written deliverable that specifically answered over 30 target questions from the LUNAFEST team. We received a testimonial from LUNAFEST as well (I think you'll need to ask Ryan for this, or it might be in some airtable? I have a screenshot if that's helpful haha)"

We also researched how natural gas pipe workers could be re-employed once we converted from natural gas to electricity.",

Phase 1 included a landscape analysis and initial literature review that then supported Phase 2 of creating the pricing model, evaluating its strengths and limitations, and future recommendations and a list of academic resources.",
                impact: "Developed a comprehensive farmland pricing model that evaluates land value per acre basis and market pricing to determine equitable and competitive leasing rates for Pattern to develop sustainable energy projects. The model was in the form of an excel sheet with variable inputs, requiring elaborate analysis and data based on geographical, agricultural, and socio-economic factors. Other deliverables included a comprehensive literature review of academic resources on the subject that could enhance the model in the future. The team learned to work with data on Excel/sheets to create pricing models and also how to conduct a literature review on academic papers, which is beyond the scope of a typical NIB Project."

Phase 1 involved looking at case studies of different meal kits that existed, detailing pros and cons. We also created what an LLS nutrition app should look like. In Phase 2, the instruction was to go broad, looking at partnership opportunities between LLS, cancer care centers, and insurance. The project was cool because we worked with the innovation team, and the team said not to worry about feasibility and to limit ideas we presented to the team but to be as creative and innovative as possible.",
